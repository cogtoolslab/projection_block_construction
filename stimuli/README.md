# Stimulus generation

```
for random(4,8) blocks:
    choose random block type
    place block in random location on other block or ground
    check for stability:
        if not stable:
            start over
save tower
```

Towers can be sampled from the larger distribution of towers generated as such, according to a priori indicators of complexity:
* number of blocks
* number of "holes" in the body mass of the tower
