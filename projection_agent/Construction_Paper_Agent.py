    In words, it tries to decompose by sliding the construction paper as far up as it can so it still decomposing the resulting silhouette. Intuitively, it places the lower edge of the construction at the upper edge of the first hole from the bottom up, then the second and so on. If it fails to build the resulting partial silhouette, it just tries the next position further up."""
